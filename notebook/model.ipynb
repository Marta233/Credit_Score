    "- **Random Forest** emerges as the top-performing model based on the following metrics:\n",
    "  - **Accuracy**: Highest among all models, indicating it correctly predicts the majority of cases.\n",
    "  - **Precision**: Demonstrates a low rate of false positives, making it reliable for positive class predictions.\n",
    "  - **Recall**: Successfully identifies most of the actual positive cases, indicating its effectiveness in capturing positive instances.\n",
    "  - **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, showcasing its overall performance in predicting the positive class.\n",
    "  - **ROC AUC**: Exhibits excellent discrimination ability between the positive and negative classes, further affirming its effectiveness.\n",

    "- Given its superior predictive capability and robustness, I will save the **Random Forest** model for future use to predict test data.\n"
